# Undergrad_Thesis
Work pertaining to my undergraduate thesis at the Department of Civil Engineering, Indian Institute of Technology Delhi, New Delhi. This focuses mainly on analysing data across 90+ reservoirs within India. The aim is to analyse and look into several trends in the data using Statistical Frameworks, particularaly those that deal with Time-Series Analysis. Further, as a next step, we apply Long Short-Term Memory based Recurrent Neural Networks to perform probabilistic forecasting of the parameters relevant to the dataset.
